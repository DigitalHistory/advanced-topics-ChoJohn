# The Next Silicon Valley

<p>
Silicon Valley is a section in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. It is notorious for the amount of tech companies that exists in the area. Also known as the ‘Valley’, receives its name from its location, Santa Clara Valley. The name ‘silicon’ is derived from the large amount of silicon chip usage. Silicon Valley is the home of many companies’ headquarters in the Fortune 1000 and thousands of startup companies. A company must carefully consider their headquarters’ location. The company must surround themselves with the right resources and a strong network for them to increase their chances of success. There are many considerable cities for a startup to begin their journey. Especially Silicon Valley, where one-third of the United States’ venture capital is invested in. However with the competition growing and companies fighting for attention, startups are now considering other cities to grow their million dollar idea. Toronto is on top of companies’ list of cities due to their infrastructure constantly producing highly skilled workers. The location is unique with its resources and the cost of operation is lower than Silicon Valley.

### Why Toronto
<p>
Toronto is an excellent candidate to be the next Silicon Valley because of its many post secondary education institutions. Michael S Malone a technology journalist and author was asked what makes Silicon Valley successful, he responded:
<blockquote>
<em>
“The third reason is infrastructure: there are few places anywhere that offered a full range of educational institutions from trade schools, to mid-level colleges, to the two great universities, Stanford and Berkeley.” [<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26041341">1</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
Toronto is the home to 6 universities and 7 colleges. Toronto universities have a total of approximately 187,000 undergraduate students. University of Toronto with the largest number of undergraduate students in Canada and York University with the third largest[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Toronto">10</a>]. Not only is there abundance of higher education, they produce talented workers every year. Vint Cerf, the fathers of the Internet and the vice president and Chief Internet Evangelist for Google said:
<blockquote>
<em>
“What results is a steady stream of well-trained engineers, business people, marketers, researchers; a vibrant venture capital community; a highly available stock market appetite for stock flotations; and people with experience in business, including how and why business failures happen.” [<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26041341">1</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
In his interview, he discussed that a stream of well-trained workers is one of the key components to Silicon Valley’s success. University of Toronto is known for its prestigious education. University of Toronto’s Engineering, Computer Science, and Rotman School of Management program is ranked number one in Canada, and is well known for their research. OCAD is the fourth largest art school in North America and the oldest in Canada [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Toronto">10</a>]. Students around the world come here to learn about art. Infamous companies such as Google and Amazon already has their eye on Toronto. Google searched through cities across North America, Europe and Australia to build their high-tech neighbourhood or their “high-tech Quayside” [<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/10/17/google-firm-wins-competition-to-build-high-tech-quayside-neighbourhood-in-toronto.html">3</a>]. Not only did Google find Toronto to be a great location for their innovation to start, Amazon is searching for their second headquarters. Amazon has included Toronto in their top 20 city list out of 238 cities that requested to be the home of Amazon’s HQ2 [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17044620011">4</a>]. It is the only city to make the list in Canada. Toronto is the perfect location with infrastructure that produces the most talented workers and already acknowledged by the infamous tech companies.

Location is a key component to a company's success. The area must have a high population with the right resources and a strong network. Toronto is the most populated city in Canada. It is the home to 4,753,120 people, making it the seventh largest city in North America [<a href="http://canada.businesschief.com/top10/1003/Canadas-Top-10-Most-Populous-Cities">2</a>]. It may not be the largest city in the world, however, it is the world’s most diverse city in the world [<a href="http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2016/05/16/toronto-the-diverse.html">5</a>].

Diversity is an important component for the success of Silicon Valley. Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur, academic and an author explains that:
<blockquote>
<em>
“What they don't realise is that what really makes the Valley tick is its culture of risk-taking and information sharing; people-to-people networks; openness to new ideas; and diversity - more than half of its innovators are foreign-born.” [<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26041341">1</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
The diverse people interacting creates the inspiration engineers and artists require to innovate. There are many innovation hubs in Toronto where startups can get support through funding and network opportunities by being under the same roof with businessman, artist and engineers. Paul Saffo from DISCERN analytics, a company that offers insights as a service to investment professionals states:
<blockquote>
<em>
“But to succeed you need an ecology of fearless players from venture capitalists to banks, suppliers and myriad other supporting businesses unafraid to risk all by helping with often flakey and unpredictable start-ups. So if you want to be the next Silicon Valley, don't copy our success. Learn to support and encourage novel and ultimately successful failure” [<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26041341">1</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
Paul Saffo highlights the importance of the type of support required for a company to succeed resulting in Silicon Valley’s success. He explains that investors should support the company through the up and downs. That is exactly the support MaRS, an innovation hub in Toronto provides. Their impact statement says:
<blockquote>
<em>
“MaRS is not just about creating billion-dollar companies, but touching a billion lives. We are creating a vanguard of entrepreneurs working to improve society for future generations and making a difference beyond our borders.” [<a href="https://www.marsdd.com/about/story/">6</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
MaRS focus on the result instead of the process which is a factor for Silicon Valley’s immense success. Toronto offers a great location to the tech companies through its people and resources that is unique with their diverse culture.

For a company to succeed in the early stages, it is important to be financially stable. Companies require to maximize their profit to continue to invest in their own company. Toronto is a cheaper alternative to Silicon Valley. Toronto provides cheaper rent for companies and their employee. Toronto is currently 58.27% cheaper than in Silicon Valley [<a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=Canada&city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&city2=Toronto&tracking=getDispatchComparison">7</a>]. To rent office space and their home can accumulate quickly. It is also cheaper to hire interns/employees in Toronto than in Silicon Valley. A founder of a startup researched the cost difference between Toronto and Silicon Valley and found that there is approximately 4 times the difference in cost.
<blockquote>
<em>
“Comparing these numbers — $190k USD for a developer in San Francisco to $48k USD for a developer in Toronto — we are looking at a ~4x difference. In other words, you could hire 4 developers in Toronto for the price of 1 in SF!” [<a href="https://medium.com/@hussein_fazal/where-to-build-your-next-tech-startup-toronto-vs-san-francisco-bff95b2ccb91">8</a>]
</em>
</blockquote>
Hiring 4 developers for the cost of 1 can result in faster development and faster results for the company. For a startup, speed is essential since there are so many startups attempting to race their product to market. Not only is it smart for employers to choose Toronto for cost, however for employees too. An article from Planet Web has reported that Toronto’s salaries are 11% more than San Francisco when adjusted for cost of living [<a href="http://www.planetweb.ca/news/toronto-salaries-11-san-francisco-adjusted-cost-living-hired-reports/ ">9</a>]. Even though San Francisco’s salaries are higher, the cost of living is also 58% higher. Toronto is clearly the strategic spot for a startup when the cost of operation is in consider.
</p>

<p>
Toronto demonstrates all the key factors that Silicon Valley had for their success. Producing an abundance of skilled workers with their infrastructure with the help of Toronto’s unique city. The city provides the correct support a startup requires and emerges the companies with a diverse culture. The cost of operation being cheaper than Silicon Valley can assist the companies to push their product to market first before their competition. Toronto provides the correct environment for any tech companies to thrive and become a billion dollar company.
